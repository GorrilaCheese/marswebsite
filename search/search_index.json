Workshops are held to teach the teams CAD, Open Rocket, GitHub, KiCad, Linux, soldering, Arduino, and ANSYS. Teams have to go through design reviews and are scored based on their documentation. Teams are taught how to make the \"default rocket.\" The competition division is geared towards beginners/first-years, but experienced rocketeers are welcome to join and make their own rocket too.</p> <p>The research division focuses on advancing the rockets and the technology. This is achieved by developing new things such as TVC, custom PCBs, building the launch pad, and developing code. The research division works somewhat on a per-project basis. All project documentation is made openly available, including CAD files and code, and tutorials are built off of it.</p> <p>There is also a third division just for logistics. This team oversees the competition and research divisions, the budget, organizes events, and creates future plans for the team.</p> <p>Many people are in multiple divisions.</p> <p>Check out our google drive and github. This website is run on this repo, join our discord. This website is designed to last many generations, and to be as easy to contribute to as possible.</p>"},{"location":"Competition-Status/","title":"Status Page","text":"<p>Check the bottom of this page to see when it was last updated.</p>"},{"location":"Competition-Status/#status","title":"Status","text":"<p>We have given out a bunch of avionics kits, you have until april 5th to solder all your components.
