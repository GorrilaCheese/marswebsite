# Status
We will keep this page up to date with the current status of where there teams should be at, and where the leads are at. **Check the bottom of this page to see when it was last updated.**

## Your status

By now your team should have a decent CAD of your rocket. You should have used the BOM from the [Rocket Guide].
Half of the teams have done the PDR, which is meant to showcase your current progress. This is not a requirement but you loose 15% on the marking if you opt out of it. Other than that optional thing, there is nothing teams need to do right now. We will be hosting tutorials 

As always feel free to reach out in your team specific discord channel if you are feeling confused about anything!

## Our status
We are having a meeting on tuesday with Alessia to use the P card to order the rocket kits. The kits will probably be ready in a month and a half. We are currently working on getting our documentation ready.
