# Status Page
We will keep this page up to date with the current status of where there teams should be at, and where the logistics are at. **Check the bottom of this page to see when it was last updated.**

## Teams Status

By now your team should have a decent CAD of your rocket. You should have used the BOM from the [Rocket Guide].
Half of the teams have done the PDR, which is meant to showcase your current progress. This is not a requirement but you loose 15% on the marking if you opt out of it. 

As always feel free to reach out in your team specific discord channel if you are feeling confused about anything!

## Our status
We are now giving out fuselages, motor mounts, and parachutes. Each team will be contacted to set up a time to pick up their supplies!
