# MARS Philosophy and Constitution

## Mission Statement

Lots will change a long the way. The most important thing is keeping the team alive, not getting stressed, and keeping an open and open source community. Mars should foster a bond between leads.
**Community first, technology second.** We will not develop any technology without a strong community of friends. People should hang out have disagreements, discuss and even fight, but resolve their problems. No serious or at all emotional discussions should be communicated over text.

Things will get progressively easier the longer the team is around, and the technology and community will draw people in.
Open source isn’t as beginner friendly as it sounds, so as the team is growing there will be documentation that never gets transferred into markdown and put on the website. But this is something we must always strive to do. The number one reason is that it makes the team easier to join if you know what is going on. The second reason is that is is the primary way to compete with other school teams. This is what puts the universities name on the map, and will enable us all to get jobs in the future. The third reason is that this is the first thing sponsors look at when checking out weather or not to sponsor us. 

One of the primary goals of leads on the team is to find younger years to replace themselves.

The leads of the competition team and advanced team have to meet with Steven, running meetings from time to time, and ensure there is an up to date website and sponsorship package.
