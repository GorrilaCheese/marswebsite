## Certification Team

**2025 Goals**

- The main goal for this year is to help members obtain Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) certifications for [Launch Canada](http://www.launchcanada.org/) 2025 (LC2025).  

- We also want to have at least one person on the team who has their L3 by the end of 2025 summer. Mars will build at least one L2 rocket for one of the L1 certified members and attempt to launch and certify before the end of May. Afterwards, an L3 rocket will be built for LC2025. The L2 rocket will be flown and certified at [URRG](https://urrg.us/). The point of this is to iron out all logistics to enable many more people acquiring their L3s in 2026.
