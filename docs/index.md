**MARS**, [TMU's] Model Rocket Society

---

Ten teams compete to launch the best rocket. Workshops are held to teach the teams CAD, Open Rocket, GitHub, KiCad, Linux, soldering, Arduino, and ANSYS. Teams have to go through design reviews and are scored based on their documentation. The competition is geared towards beginners/first-years, but experienced rocketeers are welcome to join and make their own rocket too.
