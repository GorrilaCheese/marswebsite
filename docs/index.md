**MARS**, [TMU's] Model Rocket Society, is organized into two main divisions: research and competition.

---

In the competition division, ten teams compete to launch the best rocket. Workshops are held to teach the teams CAD, Open Rocket, GitHub, KiCad, Linux, soldering, Arduino, and ANSYS. Teams have to go through design reviews and are scored based on their documentation. Teams are taught how to make the "default rocket." The competition division is geared towards beginners/first-years, but experienced rocketeers are welcome to join and make their own rocket too.

The research division focuses on advancing the rockets and the technology. This is achieved by developing new things such as TVC, custom PCBs, building the launch pad, and developing code. The research division works somewhat on a per-project basis. All project documentation is made openly available, including CAD files and code, and tutorials are built off of it.

There is also a third division just for logistics. This team oversees the competition and research divisions, the budget, organizes events, and creates future plans for the team.

Many people are in multiple divisions.
