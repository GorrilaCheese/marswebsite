# Rocket Guide

This is where we will provide detailed info on the rocket, including its materials, how it's built and its flight. Check out the [onshape] for a view of it.

The way this team works, is that we have a default template for everything including the rocket and the avionics. The teams are free to switch things and request special parts, but since most are beginners they just go with the default.

## Components

We are using F motors. We decided to go with phenolic tubes.
