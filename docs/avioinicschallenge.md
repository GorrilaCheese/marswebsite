# Avionics Challenge

Mars 2024-2025 Winter Break Avionics Challenge

**WIN $50 for Designing a PCB!**

---

## Who is this for?

This challenge is for anyone with some or no experience in PCB design who wants to learn more. Must be a 1st or 2nd year student.  No commitments and no other requirements are needed.

[Sign up link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvOUBgUmTJmOR8HCJTWi-2iwKz4vOlpNkXhPdT7K4GSJgenw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

---

## What you have to do

Design something fun (doesn't have to be avionics related) in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) and order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).

We can provide feedback on your design, but there wonâ€™t be any tutorials for this challenge.  

You can buy the components from suppliers like DigiKey or have JLCPCB assemble them for you.

Keep in mind, it takes about two weeks for a PCB to arrive from JLCPCB.

Ask questions on our [Discord!](https://discord.com/invite/BaQZkd2TKj)

## Why is MARS Hosting This?

We need help with our avionics projects! This event is a way to discover talented individuals who are skilled in PCB design.  

We may also use this opportunity to recruit for the Mars Avionics Team.  
Good luck, and happy designing!
