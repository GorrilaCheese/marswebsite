# Challenges

The Mars 2024-2025 Winter Break Avionics Challenge is live!

**WIN $50, and some MARS merch for Designing a PCB**

---

## Who is this for?

This challenge is for anyone with some or no experience in PCB design who wants to learn more. 1st and 2nd year students are prioritized. No commitments and no other requirements are needed.

Please sign up using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvOUBgUmTJmOR8HCJTWi-2iwKz4vOlpNkXhPdT7K4GSJgenw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## What you have to do

- Design something fun (doesn't have to be avionics related) in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) or [Altium](https://www.altium.com/) and order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
- Document as much as you see fit.
- Order your PCB on January 13th, submit your documentation and PCB in person to KHN03 on January 30th.


We can provide feedback on your design, but there wonâ€™t be any tutorials for this challenge.  

You can buy the components from suppliers like DigiKey or have JLCPCB assemble them for you.

Keep in mind, it takes about two weeks for a PCB to arrive from JLCPCB.

## Why is MARS Hosting This?

We need help with our avionics projects! This event is a way to discover talented individuals who are skilled in PCB design.  

We may also use this opportunity to recruit for the Mars Avionics Team.  
Good luck, and happy designing!
